# Multilevel-statistical-process-control-chart-for-personalized-patient-monitoring-A-simulation-study

This code explores a statistical approach for monitoring heart failure patients using continuously collected sensor data. Traditional methods often rely on fixed control limits and assume stable conditions, which are unrealistic in dynamic patient settings. Our work investigates the use of adaptive Statistical Process Control chart (\ac{spc}) techniques that update control thresholds in real time as new data arrive. By modeling each patient's data individually and accommodating sparse, non-stationary time series, the method improves early detection of deviations from normal patterns. This allows for more accurate and timely identification of anomalies while reducing false alarms. The results highlight the potential of individualized, data-driven monitoring systems in health applications that involve irregular and evolving signals.
